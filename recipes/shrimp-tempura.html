    Tempura batter frying is a method that dates back to mid-16th century Japan. This method of frying allows the food to stay extremely crispy
    while retaining less oil on the food. Making it healthier option than deep fried foods commonly found in the States. The most common 
    way to eat tempura is with Ten-tsuyu sauce. This sauce made with fish stock, mirin and soy sauce. Although there are many types of 
    tempura, shrimp tempura is definitely one of the most popular versions. It goes well with almost anything as you can eat it alone, with rice, 
    soba noodles and many more.

<h3>Frying</h3>

    <li>Score the shrimp in order to straighten it. Pat the shrimp dry to remove any moisture.</li>

        the oil is ready, dip the tip of your chopsticks in the oil and if it bubbles, it is ready.
