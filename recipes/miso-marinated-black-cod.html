    Black Miso Cod, best known from the michelin star restaurant Nobu, is a flavorful yet light dish. Contrary to it's name
    Black Miso Cod is not actually cod. This Japanese dish is actually made with Sablefish fillets soaked in a marinated of 
    Saikyo Miso, traditionally for up to 5-7 days. The marinade is called Saikyozuke, once the fish is cooked through grilling
    or broiling, it is called Saikyo Yaki. The result of this long marinating time and delicate cooking results in a very 
    soft and flaky fish, jam packed full of umami.

<p>
    This buttery fish pairs well with rice, steamed or pickled vegetables and even soba noodles. The sharpness of the Saikyo Miso 
    counteracts with the fattiness of the Sablefish and is paired well with a dry white wine. I highly recommend trying this 
    simple dish that shines through it's preparation a go, it will surely impress everyone at the dinner table.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 Fillets Sablefish</li>
    <li>2 Tsp Kosher Salt</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp Sake</li>
    <h3> Miso Marinade</h3>
    <li>6 Tbsp Saikyo Miso</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp Mirin</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp Sake</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients together. Try to pick out the freshest fish possible from the market
        as you will be marinating it for a couple days.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Marinating (2-3 days from serving)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sprinke salt over the fish and set aside for 30 minutes. This will help draw out the moisture in the fish
        and reduce the fishy odor.
    </li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix together the saikyo miso, mirin and sake.</li>
    <li>Pour the marinade into a flat bottom air tight container</li>
    <li>Pour 2 Tbsp of sake over the fish to wash off the salt and gently pat dry with a paper towel. <b>
        Do not rinse the fish with running water
    </b> </li>
    <li>Put the fish inside the container and completely cover it with the marinade. Take a spoon and cover the top of the fish 
        with the marinade as well. Cover it and let it sit for <b> 2 to 3 days.</b>
    </li>
    <li>After the fish is done marinating, remove the fish and wipe the marinade off completely. Do not leave excess 
        on the fish since it will burn when cooking. 
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cooking</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the broiler for about 5 minutes. There are commonly three broiler settings, turn it on high for this recipe.</li>
    <li>Place the fish onto a baking sheet lined with foil and broil for 8-10 minutes until the top has browned a bit.
        Cooking time varies by the thickness of each fillet so be wary. <b>You do not need to flip the fish</b>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Serving</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Once the fish is finished cooking, serve with white rice or soba noodles. I like to plate the fish on a bed of 
        steamed vegetables for nice contrast. You may garnish it with bean sprouts or sliced radish for presentation.
